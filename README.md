# Portfolio

I'm a Data Scientist that used to work as a Software Engineer. I recently completed my Master of Management Analytics at Rotman (University of Toronto). Below are some of my personal Data Science projects as well as a few selected projects of the many that I completed as part of my master's program.

Some of the project titles can be clicked on to visit the repo and relevant Jupyter Notebooks 

## [John Mayer Lyrics Analysis using NLP](https://github.com/numalj/John-Mayer-Lyrics-Analysis "John Mayer Lyrics Analysis Notebook") 

* A [series of notebooks](https://github.com/numalj/John-Mayer-Lyrics-Analysis "John Mayer Lyrics Analysis Notebook") that analyze the lyrics used by John Mayer across his albums. 
* Analysis includes **sentiment analysis, topic modeling and analysis of vocabulary**.

## Time Series Forecasting model for Quarterly Stock Prices 

* Worked with my team mates at Rotman, to build a time series model that that identifies potential best performing stocks of the next quarter
* Scraped call transcripts for sentiment analysis (NLP) and used historical prices of stocks to train financial models from research papers.
* Models included Earnings Persistence and Residual Income Model


## [Medical Heart Beat Anomaly Classifier using LSTM](https://github.com/numalj/Hearbeat-Classification-LSTM)

Heart disease is a leading cause of death in Canada. Certain heart beat anomalies can be identified by listening to the pattern of 'lub'-'dub's in the heart beat. Using machine learning the task of identifying an anomaly can be automated in order to help unaware patients identify any hidden conditions and can also be used as pre-screening mechanism to help reduce load on the healthcare system.

* Preprocessed and Augmented audio files to create a larger training set, since there was a very limited set of available 
* Built a RNN + LSTM model to classify heart beat sounds with 65% sensitivity
* The audio files had to be converted to mfcc format so that they could be used in our model
